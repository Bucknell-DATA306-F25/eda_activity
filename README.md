# EDA Activity

> "The EAMMi2 data set includes responses from 3,134 undergraduate students at 32
different institutions. Participants answered questions across several different
variables, including basic demographic questions, questions about personal
experiences, and questions about well-being. The overarching goal of this study
was to learn more about the psychological experiences of 18-29 year-olds, the age
range associated with the transition from adolescence to adulthood. The final
sample size of respondents between the ages of 18 and 29 was 2,073. You can
learn more about the EAMMi2 study [here](https://osf.io/te54b/)."

We will be working with a reduced version of the original EAMMi2 data.
